What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?

Ans. In dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated during runtime. 
But, in this case, it is the responsibility of a programmer to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory when itâ€™s no longer in use. 
Otherwise, it leads to memory leaks.

Uses of Dynamic Memory Allocation
There are times when we do not know in advance the amount of memory required to store some data. 
Using dynamic memory allocation, we can allocate memory of variable size at runtime.
It provides flexibility to the programmer. Programmers can allocate and deallocate memory as and when needed.

C++ provides two unary operators, new and delete, to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory efficiently.

For Example:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 

int main()
{
    int* val = NULL;
    val = new int;
    *val = 123;
    cout << "Value is : " << *val << endl;
    delete val;
}
